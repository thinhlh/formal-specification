# Notice and Recent Error
Due to the built-in logical keyboard is in Beta state, sometimes users might counter the error below: 

```
A KeyUpEvent is dispatched, but the state shows that the physical key is not pressed. If this occurs in real application, please report this bug to Flutter. If this occurs in unit tests, please ensure that simulated events follow Flutter's event model as documented in `HardwareKeyboard`. This was the event: KeyUpEvent#8d33e(physicalKey: PhysicalKeyboardKey#700e0(usbHidUsage: "0x000700e0", debugName: "Control Left"), logicalKey: LogicalKeyboardKey#00100(keyId: "0x200000100", keyLabel: "Control Left", debugName: "Control Left"), character: null, timeStamp: 52:40:49.694077, synthesized)

Failed assertion: line 441 pos 16: '_pressedKeys.containsKey(event.physicalKey)'
